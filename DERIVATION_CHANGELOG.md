# Derivation Changelog

Tracks changes to PatientRecord derivation logic in
`omop_core/services/patient_record_service.py`. Bump `DERIVATION_VERSION`
whenever aggregation or computation logic changes, then add a row here.

After bumping, run `python manage.py backfill_patient_records` to re-derive
stale records.
